    <h1>Baking</h1>
    
    <p>I love cooking and baking, and love helping my mom prepare and cook for our meals, as well as helping around the house cleaning a lot. It's so much fun getting my hands dirty and using my hands to make things. I enjoy helping and doing things for other people, even if they don't need my help, especially making things.
    
    <p>My favorite things to bake are cookies -</p>

    <p> I've also made pizza and ice-cream, which was super fun! Including making the dough and sauce for the pizza, and adding/mixing all the ingredients for the ice-cream together and shaking it for it to form.</p>
