    <h1>Hi, Welcome! Read all about me, and the things that I am interested in!</h1>

    <p id="content"> My website includes the three things that I love most, they are my favorite things to do and see. Those things are playing my instruments, baking, and animals and they all feel very relaxing and comforting.</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about those three things I am interested in, you can go to each of the tabs to read a bit more about it, and maybe you will learn some things that you didn't know about. They are all located in my navigation bar at the top.</p>
